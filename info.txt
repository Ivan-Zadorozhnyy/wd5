API provides ability to create, review, update and delete entities consisting of name and description.

DB:
the database chosen is MongoDB, it was chosen because of its easy-to-use functionality and accessibility
connection to MongoDB:
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGO_URI)
    .then(() => console.log('MongoDB connection successful'))
    .catch(err => console.error('MongoDB connection error:', err));

Models:
here I create schema for my entity:
const entitySchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    name: { type: String, required: true },
    description: { type: String, required: false },
});

and then create the model itself:
const Entity = mongoose.model('Entity', entitySchema);
